The complete plan for renovating the room is as follows:
1. Empty the cupboards, wardrobes, and shelves of any portable objects that can be moved to a different part of the apartment for the time being. Additionally, sift through the belongings, determining whether any can be discarded.
2. Find a suitable storage for the loose items gathered in the prior step.
3. Move the remaining heavy furniture towards the centre of the room, leaving enough space to allow easy access to the walls and ceiling.
4. Check electrical outlets for any damage or signs of coming loose. Fix if necessary.
5. Inspect the integrity of the walls; sand and fill any holes.
6. Determine if window frames and sills require any repairs/renovations. Carry these out if needed. Do the same for door hinges.
7. Paint the walls and ceiling with a colour of choice.
8. Watch the paint dry.
9. Move the furniture back to its original or new position.
10. Populate the furniture with the items removed in the first step.
